# JSRoutechecker
Hi! This is a route checker made for JS! 
You parse a endpoint list ex: [/, /home, /login] and it will automaticly check them 
You can also parse: 
location (Coming soon! But will allow  you to display your results) 
filterby (number for status code (200, 404 etc), string : Endpoint name) 
timeout -- expresses the time (in milliseconds) before uncompleted requests times out
