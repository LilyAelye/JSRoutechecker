# JSRoutechecker
Hi! This is a route checker made for JS! \n
You parse a endpoint list ex: [/, /home, /login] and it will automaticly check them \n
You can also parse: \n 
location (Coming soon! But will allow  you to display your results) \n 
filterby (number for status code (200, 404 etc), string : Endpoint name) \n
timeout -- expresses the time (in milliseconds) before uncompleted requests times out \n
